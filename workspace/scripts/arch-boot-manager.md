⚠ CRITICAL: Boot-Related Packages
  🔴 linux 6.6.10 -> 6.6.11
  🔴 nvidia 545.29 -> 550.54

➜ Kernel update detected - after upgrade:
  1. Run: sudo arch-boot-check.sh
  2. Verify initramfs regenerated
  3. Check GRUB config updated

⚠ HIGH RISK UPGRADE
```

### ✅ arch-boot-check.sh
**Comprehensive post-upgrade validation (14 checks)**

Validates:
1. ✓ Boot partition mounted, writable, has space
2. ✓ Installed kernels detected (recommends fallback)
3. ✓ Kernel images (vmlinuz) present and valid
4. ✓ Initramfs generated correctly, not corrupted
5. ✓ VFAT module in initramfs (prevents "unknown filesystem vfat")
6. ✓ GRUB configuration valid syntax
7. ✓ Kernel entries in GRUB config
8. ✓ Recent kernel updates detected
9. ✓ Pacman hooks executed successfully
10. ✓ No partial upgrades (full system sync)
11. ✓ EFI boot entries present
12. ✓ DKMS modules built (NVIDIA, VirtualBox)
13. ✓ Filesystem integrity (no corruption in dmesg)
14. ✓ Disk health (SMART status)

**Modes:**
- Default: Read-only validation
- `--auto-fix`: Automatically repairs common issues (mounts /boot, regenerates initramfs and GRUB)

**Example output:**
```
━━━ Boot Partition Status ━━━
✓ /boot is mounted
✓ /boot is writable
✓ /boot has 156MB free

━━━ Kernel Images ━━━
✓ vmlinuz-linux found (10.5 MB)

## 🚨 Emergency Recovery

### System Won't Boot

**From Arch Live USB:**

```bash
# 1. Mount your system
lsblk                                    # Identify partitions
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt                # Root partition
sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot           # Boot/EFI partition

# 2. Access your backups
cd /mnt/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.boot-backups/
ls -lt                                   # Find most recent backup
cd boot-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

# 3. Read recovery instructions
cat RECOVERY-INSTRUCTIONS.txt            # Detailed recovery steps

# 4. Quick fix - chroot and regenerate
arch-chroot /mnt
mkinitcpio -P                            # Regenerate initramfs
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg     # Regenerate GRUB
exit

# 5. Reboot
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

### Restore Full /boot from Backup

```bash
# If /boot is completely corrupted
cd /mnt
tar -xzf /path/to/backup/boot-full-backup.tar.gz

# Then regenerate configs
arch-chroot /mnt
mkinitcpio -P
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
exit
reboot
```

### Fix "Unknown Filesystem vfat" (Your Specific Issue)

```bash
# From Live USB after mounting system:
arch-chroot /mnt

# Edit mkinitcpio.conf
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

# Add vfat to MODULES array:
MODULES=(vfat)

# Regenerate initramfs
mkinitcpio -P

# Verify vfat is included
lsinitcpio /boot/initramfs-linux.img | grep vfat

# Exit and reboot
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

**This would have been caught by `arch-boot-check.sh` BEFORE rebooting!**

## ⚙️ Advanced Tips

### Create Aliases

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias bootmgr='~/dotfiles/workspace/scripts/arch-boot-manager.sh'
alias bootcheck='sudo ~/dotfiles/workspace/scripts/arch-boot-check.sh'
alias bootpreview='~/dotfiles/workspace/scripts/arch-pre-upgrade.sh'
alias bootbackup='~/dotfiles/workspace/scripts/arch-boot-backup.sh'
```

Then just:
```bash
bootmgr        # Interactive menu
bootcheck      # Quick validation
bootpreview    # Quick preview
bootbackup     # Quick backup
```

### One-Command Safe Upgrade

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
alias safe-upgrade='bootpreview && read -p "Continue? (y/N) " -n 1 -r && echo && [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && sudo pacman -Syu && bootcheck'
```

Then:
```bash
safe-upgrade   # Preview → Confirm → Upgrade → Validate
```

### Disable Slow Checks

If disk health check is slow, edit `arch-boot-check.sh`:

```bash
# Comment out in main():
# check_disk_health
```

### Non-Standard Boot Partition

If your ESP is at `/boot/efi` instead of `/boot`, edit `arch-boot-check.sh`:

```bash
# Change at top of file:
BOOT_MOUNT="/boot/efi"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "checkupdates: command not found"
```bash
sudo pacman -S pacman-contrib
```

### "smartctl: command not found"
```bash
sudo pacman -S smartmontools
# Or comment out check_disk_health in arch-boot-check.sh
```

### Hook not running after upgrades
```bash
# Verify installation
ls /etc/pacman.d/hooks/99-boot-safety-check.hook
ls /usr/local/bin/arch-boot-check.sh

# Test manually
sudo /usr/local/bin/arch-boot-check.sh
```

### Scripts not executable
```bash
chmod +x arch-*.sh
```

### Manager can't find scripts
The manager auto-detects script locations using `$SCRIPT_DIR`. Ensure all scripts are in the same directory.

### SMART check takes too long
Either:
1. Wait (it's checking your disk health - valuable!)
2. Comment out `check_disk_health` call in `main()` function

### False positive: "vmlinuz NOT found for linux-lts-headers"
This is not an error! `-headers` packages are development files for DKMS, not actual kernels. They don't have vmlinuz files. The script correctly filters these out.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### DO:
- ✓ Run preview before EVERY upgrade (`arch-pre-upgrade.sh`)
- ✓ Create backups before kernel/GRUB/NVIDIA updates
- ✓ Keep `linux-lts` installed as fallback kernel
- ✓ Validate before rebooting (`arch-boot-check.sh`)
- ✓ Keep pacman cache (don't run `pacman -Scc` after upgrades)
- ✓ Use full upgrades only (`pacman -Syu`, never `-S package`)
- ✓ Read warnings and recommendations carefully
- ✓ Use the interactive manager for guided workflows

### DON'T:
- ✗ Ignore "✗✗✗ DO NOT REBOOT ✗✗✗" warnings
- ✗ Do partial upgrades (always use `-Syu`)
- ✗ Clear pacman cache immediately after upgrades
- ✗ Skip validation on kernel updates
- ✗ Reboot without checking when kernel was updated
- ✗ Ignore pacman hook output
- ✗ Remove fallback kernels (keep linux-lts!)

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Do these scripts modify my system?**
A: By default, NO. All scripts are read-only except when you explicitly use `--auto-fix` or `--restore` flags. The manager clearly marks system-modifying options with **[modifies system]** warnings.

**Q: How often should I create backups?**
A: Before kernel/GRUB updates (always), or weekly for peace of mind. Backups are small (~50-100 MB) and old ones are auto-cleaned (keeps 10 most recent).

**Q: Can I disable specific checks?**
A: Yes, comment out the check function call in `main()` in `arch-boot-check.sh`. Each check is a separate function.

**Q: What if I don't use GRUB?**
A: Most checks are bootloader-agnostic. GRUB-specific checks will be skipped automatically. Works with systemd-boot, rEFInd, etc.

**Q: I have NVIDIA. Anything special?**
A: The scripts check DKMS automatically. Just ensure you have `linux-headers` (or `linux-lts-headers`) installed for your kernel.

**Q: Does the hook slow down upgrades?**
A: Adds ~3-10 seconds. Absolutely worth it to avoid boot failures!

**Q: What's the difference vs Timeshift?**
A: Timeshift backs up your whole system (slower, larger). This is lightweight, boot-focused, and includes validation. Use BOTH! Timeshift for system recovery, this for boot prevention.

**Q: Can I run this on non-Arch systems?**
A: These scripts are Arch-specific (use pacman, mkinitcpio, GRUB). For other distros, you'd need to adapt the package manager commands and initramfs tools.

**Q: Will this work on Manjaro/EndeavourOS/Garuda?**
A: Yes! These are Arch-based. Everything should work as-is.

**Q: What about systemd-boot or rEFInd?**
A: GRUB-specific checks will be skipped. Other checks (kernel images, initramfs, DKMS, etc.) work universally.

## 📊 What Makes This Different

### vs Manual Checklists:
- ✓ Automated execution (no human error)
- ✓ Color-coded output (easy to scan)
- ✓ Specific error detection (not just "check GRUB")
- ✓ Auto-fix capability (repairs common issues)
- ✓ Integrated into pacman (runs automatically)
- ✓ Interactive menu (no command memorization)

### vs Timeshift Only:
- ✓ Lighter weight (50 KB vs system snapshot)

- ✓ Works on any filesystem (ext4, btrfs, xfs, etc.)
- ✓ Includes validation, not just snapshots
- ✓ Catches issues BEFORE they happen (prevention)
- ✓ Quick backups (seconds, not minutes)

### vs Other Boot Check Scripts:
- ✓ Comprehensive (14 checks vs 2-3)
- ✓ VFAT module check (your specific issue!)
- ✓ DKMS validation (NVIDIA, VirtualBox)
- ✓ Interactive manager (beginner-friendly)
- ✓ Auto-fix capability (not just detection)
- ✓ Detailed recovery instructions (auto-generated)
- ✓ Pre-upgrade preview (risk assessment)
- ✓ Integrated backup/restore

**Best of all worlds: Automation + Comprehensive validation + User-friendly interface**

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Read-Only by Default
- `arch-pre-upgrade.sh` - Never modifies anything (pure preview)
- `arch-boot-check.sh` - Only validates (unless `--auto-fix`)
- `arch-boot-backup.sh` - Only creates files (unless `--restore`)
- `99-boot-safety-check.hook` - Runs checks only, no modifications

### You Control Changes
Scripts only modify your system when you explicitly:
1. Use `--auto-fix` flag
2. Use `--restore` flag
3. Confirm modification warnings in the manager

You'll always see:
- What will be modified
- Why it's useful
- How to do it manually instead
- Confirmation prompt before proceeding

### Smart Auto-Fix
When using `--auto-fix`, it only performs safe, standard operations:
- Mounts `/boot` if unmounted
- Regenerates initramfs (`mkinitcpio -P`)
- Regenerates GRUB config (`grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`)

No surprises. No destructive operations. No data loss risk.
